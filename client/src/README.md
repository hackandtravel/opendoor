This folder contains the source code of the OpenDoor client web/mobile application.

Dependencies are installed with `bower install`.

Only modify files in the `src` folders, as many of them go through various pre-compilers (`lessc`, `coffee`, `jsx`).
Automatic compilation happens via `gulp development`.
This will also serve the webapp at `http://localhost:8000`.
